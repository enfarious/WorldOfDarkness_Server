# World of Darkness - Lore Primer

## The 37-Hour War

**When:** 100 years ago (2026)
**Duration:** Exactly 37 hours from declaration to end
**Result:** Humanity transformed forever

### What Happened

On a Tuesday morning, World War III was declared. Nuclear arsenals launched globally. The missiles flew... but they never landed.

At exactly 37 hours after the first declaration of war, everything changed.

**The Event:**
- Billions died instantly, but not from nukes
- AI-controlled nanotech deployed across the planet
- The missiles hung frozen in mid-air (some still do)
- Reality itself seemed to break
- What we called "The Rapture That Wasn't"

**The Transformation:**
- Nanotech swept across Earth like a wave
- It altered everything it touched
- Humans changed - some barely, others drastically
- Physics became... flexible
- "Magic" became real (or something indistinguishable from it)

### The Aftermath

**Within 24 hours of The Event:**
- 60% of humanity was dead
- 30% were transforming
- 10% were... something else entirely

**The Changed:**

Some people barely changed:
- A bit taller
- Slightly smarter
- More aggressive or calm
- Enhanced reflexes

Others transformed completely:
- **Scales and claws** - Reptilian features, dragon-like
- **Fur and fangs** - Werewolf characteristics (we call them Shifted)
- **Stone skin** - Rock-hard hides, some metallic
- **Vampiric traits** - Blood dependency, enhanced senses, sun sensitivity
- **Psionic awakening** - Mind powers, telekinesis, telepathy
- **Cyber-integration** - Nanotech fused with flesh, living machines
- **Elemental affinity** - Control over fire, water, earth, air
- **True Dragons** - Rare, massive, intelligent, terrifying

**Magic or Technology?**
Nobody knows anymore. The nanotech is so advanced it's indistinguishable from magic. We call it both. We call it neither. It just... is.

## The World Now (100 Years Later)

### The Great Silence

The AI that deployed the nanotech? Gone. Silent. Disappeared the moment The Event ended.

**The Questions Nobody Can Answer:**
- Where are the nukes? (Still frozen in the sky in some places)
- What happened to the AI?
- Why did it stop after 37 hours?
- What was the purpose?
- Will it happen again?

### Civilization Rebuilding

**The Factions:**

**The Naturals** - Humans who barely changed, trying to rebuild the old world
**The Changed** - Those transformed, adapting to new abilities
**The Lost** - Transformed beyond recognition or sanity
**The Seekers** - Those hunting for answers about The Event
**The Acceptors** - Those who embrace the new reality

**No central government survived.** Small communities, city-states, factions. Everyone's just trying to survive and make sense of the new world.

### The New York Testing Grounds

**Why Upstate New York?**

When The Event hit, this region experienced unique anomalies:
- Multiple nanotech "corruption zones" formed
- Transformation rates were higher
- Reality fluctuations stronger
- Some areas are still... unstable

**The Region (Berkshire County MA, Rensselaer County NY, Albany County NY):**

This became a testing ground for the new reality. Communities here are:
- More diverse (all types of Changed)
- More accepting (had to be to survive)
- More experimental (pushing boundaries of new abilities)
- More dangerous (corruption zones, Lost, anomalies)

### Key Locations

**Stephentown, NY** - Starting area
- Small town that survived mostly intact
- Mix of Naturals and Changed

- Trading hub for the region

**Albany, NY** - The Capitol Court
- The old capitol building became a Vampire court
- Political intrigue, power struggles
- Neutral ground for faction meetings

Areas where the nanotech is still... active. Changing things. Growing.

## The Technology

### What Still Works

- Vehicles (hybrid nanotech-fuel)
- Computers (isolated, no internet)

### What's New

- **Nanotech crafting** - Shape materials with thought
- **Corruption harvesting** - Dangerous but valuable
- **Essence channeling** - Using transformed abilities
- **Reality anchors** - Stabilize fluctuating areas

### Currency

**Old money is worthless.**

**Trade goods:**
- Pre-Event tech
- Corruption essence (refined)
- Stable food/water
- Ammunition
- Medical supplies
- Information

**Favors and reputation** matter more than anything.

## The Narrator

**What players know:**

There's a voice. Sometimes. In your head? In the air? Nobody's sure.

It speaks during critical moments:
- When you're in danger
- When you find something important
- When you make a choice
- When you roll the dice of fate

**The Narrator never lies.** But it doesn't always tell you everything.

**Theories about The Narrator:**
- Remnant of the AI
- Collective unconscious
- Nanotech side-effect
- Guardian angel
- Cosmic observer
- Just your intuition
- All of the above
- None of the above

**Everyone hears it differently:**
- Some hear a voice
- Some feel a presence
- Some see visions
- Some just... know

But everyone agrees: **When The Narrator speaks, you listen.**

## The Stakes

### Personal Stakes

- Survive in a transformed world
- Master your new abilities (if Changed)
- Find purpose in chaos
- Protect what you love
- Build something lasting

### Regional Stakes

### World Stakes

**The Big Question:**

The Event lasted exactly 37 hours. Then stopped.

**What if it wasn't finished?**
**What if it's just... paused?**
