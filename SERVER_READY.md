# Server Ready for First Connection

## Status: READY ✅

Your World of Darkness MMO server is ready to accept its first connection!

## What's Been Done

### 1. Environment Setup ✅
- All dependencies installed
- Environment configuration (.env) created
- TypeScript compiled successfully

### 2. Protocol Implementation ✅
- Complete handshake flow implemented
- Type-safe message definitions
- Guest authentication working
- Character creation with mock data
- World entry with sample zone

### 3. Test Tools ✅
- Test client script (`test-client.js`)
- Protocol documentation (`PROTOCOL.md`)
- Quick start guide (`QUICKSTART.md`)

## How to Start the Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Expected output:
```
Starting World of Darkness MMO Server...
Environment: development
HTTP server listening on port 3000
WebSocket server initialized
World initialized with 1 zones
Game loop started at 10 ticks per second
Game server fully initialized
```

## Test It

In another terminal:
```bash
node test-client.js
```

You should see:
- ✓ Connection established
- ✓ Handshake successful
- ✓ Guest authentication
- ✓ Character creation
- ✓ World entry with "The Crossroads" zone
- ✓ Ping/pong test
- Clean disconnect

## What Your Client Developer Needs

### Documentation
1. **`PROTOCOL.md`** - Full protocol specification
   - All message types
   - Message formats (JSON)
   - Connection flow
   - Examples for text/2D/3D/VR clients

2. **`QUICKSTART.md`** - Getting started guide
   - How to connect
   - Code examples
   - Common issues

3. **`test-client.js`** - Working reference implementation
   - Complete handshake flow
   - All message examples
   - Text-based world display

### Connection Details
- **Server URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Protocol Version**: `1.0.0`
- **Transport**: WebSocket (Socket.io)

### First Connection Sequence

```
1. Connect WebSocket → Server assigns socket ID
2. Send 'handshake' → Get 'handshake_ack'
3. Send 'auth' (guest) → Get 'auth_success'
4. Send 'character_create' → Get 'world_entry'
5. Connected! Receive zone, entities, exits
```

## What Works Right Now

✅ **Handshake**: Version checking, client capabilities
✅ **Authentication**: Guest accounts (no password needed for testing)
✅ **Character Creation**: Create new characters (stored in memory)
✅ **World Entry**: Receive full world state
✅ **Mock World**: The Crossroads zone with NPC and exits
✅ **Ping/Pong**: Connection health monitoring
✅ **Error Handling**: Proper error messages

## What's Still Mock Data

🔧 **Database**: Using in-memory data (Prisma not connected yet)
🔧 **Characters**: Created on-the-fly, not persisted
🔧 **World State**: Static "Crossroads" zone
🔧 **NPCs**: One static merchant
🔧 **Authentication**: Guests only (no real accounts yet)

## What's Not Implemented Yet

❌ Movement handling (receives messages but doesn't process)
❌ Chat system (receives messages but doesn't broadcast)
❌ Combat system
❌ State updates (entities moving/changing)
❌ Multiple players seeing each other
❌ Credential authentication
❌ Database persistence

## The Mock World

When a client connects, they enter **"The Crossroads"**:

```
The Crossroads
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

A weathered crossroads where five ancient paths converge.
Moss-covered stones mark each direction, their inscriptions
long faded. A sense of anticipation hangs in the air.

Weather: clear | Time: dusk | Lighting: dim

Nearby:
  - Old Merchant [?]
    A weathered merchant with kind eyes, tending a small cart.

Exits:
  [north] Forest Path - A dark trail leading into dense woods
  [south] King's Road - A well-maintained road toward civilization
  [east] Mountain Pass - A steep rocky path ascending into the peaks
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## Message Format Example

All messages follow this pattern:

```javascript
// Client → Server
{
  "type": "move",
  "payload": {
    "method": "direction",
    "direction": "north",
    "timestamp": 1234567890
  }
}

// Server → Client
{
  "type": "event",
  "payload": {
    "eventType": "movement",
    "narrative": "You head north along the forest path...",
    "timestamp": 1234567891
  }
}
```

## For the Text Client Developer

Your client should:

1. **Connect** to ws://localhost:3000
2. **Display** the narrative descriptions from `world_entry`
3. **Show** available exits as commands (north, south, east)
4. **List** nearby entities (NPCs, players, objects)
5. **Send** movement commands when user types directions
6. **Display** events as they arrive (chat, combat, etc.)

The server sends everything needed for text rendering:
- `description` - Narrative text
- `narrative` - Event descriptions
- `exits` - Direction-based navigation
- `entities` - Named objects with descriptions

## Performance Notes

- Server tick rate: 10 TPS (configurable)
- Text clients get ~1 update/second
- Connection health checked via ping/pong
- Graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT

## Logs

Server logs everything:
- Connections/disconnections
- Handshakes
- Authentication attempts
- Character creation
- All incoming messages (debug level)

Set `LOG_LEVEL=debug` in `.env` for verbose logging.

## Ready to Go!

Everything is in place for your client developer to start connecting. The handshake works, authentication works, and they'll get proper world data back.

You can now:
1. Start the server (`npm run dev`)
2. Run the test client (`node test-client.js`)
3. Share the protocol docs with your client dev
4. Begin implementing the actual game systems!
