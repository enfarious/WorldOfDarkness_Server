## Derived Stats (Calculated from Core Stats)

These are automatically calculated from your core stats + equipment + buffs.

### Combat - Physical

**Attack Rating (ATK)**
```
Base ATK = Weapon Base Damage + Primary Stat Bonus
Primary Stat = STR (heavy weapons), DEX (precision), or AGI (speed weapons)
Formula: Base ATK + (Primary Stat × Weapon Stat Scaling)
```

**Defense Rating (DEF)**
```
DEF = Base Armor + (VIT × 0.5) + Equipment Bonuses
Reduces physical damage taken
```

**Physical Accuracy (P.ACC)**
```
P.ACC = 75 + (DEX × 2) + Weapon Accuracy Bonus + Buffs
Determines hit chance vs target's Evasion
```

**Evasion (EVA)**
```
EVA = 5 + (AGI × 2) + Equipment Bonuses
Determines dodge chance vs attacker's Accuracy
```

**Damage Absorption (ABS)**
```
ABS = (VIT × 0.3) + Armor ABS + Buffs
Flat damage reduction before DEF calculation
```

**Glancing Blow Chance (GBC)**
```
GBC = (AGI × 0.5)%
Chance to convert hit into glancing blow (50% damage)
```

### Combat - Magical

**Magic Attack (M.ATK)**

## Next Steps

1. **Define ability templates** - Create ability definitions (damage, cooldown, cost, effects)
2. **Implement stat calculation** - Build derived stat calculator
3. **Create ability trees** - Design skill trees for different builds
4. **Equipment special abilities** - Define equipment-linked specials
5. **Combat formula** - Hit/miss/damage calculations using stats
6. **Dev tools** - Character builder, stat calculator, ability tester

This system gives **massive build variety** while keeping combat tactical and controller-friendly. The 8/8/4 limit forces meaningful choices.

Want me to start implementing any of this?
