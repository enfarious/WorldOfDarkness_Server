## Priority 1: Combat System Implementation

With spatial navigation now complete (bearing/elevation/range), we can implement the core combat mechanics.

### Why This Is Next

- **Foundation Ready**: We have:
  - Full stat system (core + derived stats)
  - Ability point system and loadouts (8 active, 8 passive, 4 special)
  - Spatial targeting data for all entities
  - Proximity roster with combat awareness (`dangerState` flag)

- **Natural Progression**: Combat builds directly on spatial navigation
  - Text clients can `attack giant.ant.1` using bearing/range
  - 3D clients can click entities and use spatial data for positioning
  - LLM NPCs can make tactical decisions with proximity data

### Key Components to Implement

#### 1. Ability System
- **Ability Definitions** (database schema)
  - ID, name, description, icon
  - Type: physical, magic, special
  - Cost: HP, stamina, mana
  - Cooldown, cast time, range
  - Targeting: single, AoE, self, cone, line
  - Damage formula referencing derived stats
  - Status effects applied

- **Ability Execution**
  - Validate target in range
  - Check resource costs
  - Apply cooldowns
  - Calculate damage/effects using derived stats
  - Send combat events to all nearby players

#### 2. Combat Loop
- **Turn Resolution** (already have `COMBAT_TICK_RATE=20`)
  - Initiative system (uses `derivedStats.initiative`)
  - Action queue processing
  - Auto-attack system
  - Ability queue management

- **Damage Calculation**
  - Physical: `attackRating` vs `defenseRating`, modified by `physicalAccuracy` and `evasion`
  - Magic: `magicAttack` vs `magicDefense`, modified by `magicAccuracy` and `magicEvasion`
  - Absorption: `damageAbsorption` and `magicAbsorption` reduce incoming damage
  - Glancing blows: `glancingBlowChance` for partial damage
  - Critical hits (if implementing)

- **Combat State**
  - Enter/exit combat mode
  - Set `dangerState` in proximity roster (gates CFH usage)
  - Combat timeout (auto-exit after X seconds of no actions)

#### 3. Status Effects
- **Effect Types**
  - Buffs (stat increases, shields, regeneration)
  - Debuffs (stat decreases, DoTs, stuns, slows)
  - Duration tracking
  - Stack management

- **Effect Application**
  - Apply on ability hit
  - Tick processing (DoTs, HoTs)
  - Expiration handling
  - Display to client

#### 4. Combat Events
- **Event Messages** (send to all nearby players)
  - `combat_start`: Combat initiated
  - `combat_action`: Ability used
  - `combat_hit`: Damage dealt
  - `combat_miss`: Attack missed
  - `combat_effect`: Status effect applied/removed
  - `combat_death`: Entity defeated
  - `combat_end`: Combat concluded

### Files to Create/Modify

**New Files:**
- `src/combat/CombatManager.ts` - Core combat loop, turn resolution
- `src/combat/AbilitySystem.ts` - Ability execution, cooldowns

## Priority 3: NPC AI Enhancement

The LLM integration is set up, but NPCs need more behaviors beyond chat.

### Why This Is Third

- **Combat Dependency**: NPCs need combat system to fight back
- **Spatial Navigation**: NPCs can now make movement decisions using bearing/elevation/range
- **LLM Foundation**: Already have multi-provider support (Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible)

### Key Components to Enhance

#### 1. Movement AI
- **Decision Making**
  - Wandering behavior (random walk within zone bounds)
  - Following targets (companions, hostile mobs)
  - Fleeing from danger (low HP, overwhelmed)
  - Patrolling routes (guards, merchants)

- **Using Spatial Data**
  - NPCs receive same proximity roster as players
  - Can navigate toward/away from entities using bearing/range
  - Respect movement speeds (walk/jog/run)

#### 2. Combat AI
- **Target Selection**
  - Aggro system (threat table)
  - Target switching (healers, low HP targets)
  - AoE positioning

- **Ability Usage**
  - Ability priority system
  - Cooldown management
  - Resource conservation (don't spam expensive abilities)
  - Tactical decisions (heal when low HP, buff before combat)

#### 3. LLM-Enhanced Behaviors
- **Personality-Driven Actions**
  - Friendly merchant: approaches players, initiates trade
  - Hostile guard: challenges trespassers, attacks on aggression
  - Mysterious wanderer: avoids crowds, cryptic emotes

- **Context-Aware Responses**
  - React to combat (flee, fight, call for help)
  - React to world events (zone transitions, weather changes)
  - React to player actions (trade requests, gifts, threats)

#### 4. Memory & Relationships
- **Short-Term Memory**
  - Recent conversations (last 10 messages)
  - Recent interactions (trades, combat, gifts)
  - Current goals/objectives

- **Long-Term Memory** (database-backed)
  - Relationship tracking (friendly, neutral, hostile per player)
  - Quest state per player
  - Learned facts about world/players

### Files to Modify/Create

**Enhance:**
- `src/ai/NPCController.ts` - Add movement, combat, and decision-making
- `src/ai/LLMService.ts` - Add action generation beyond chat (move, attack, use item)
- `src/world/DistributedWorldManager.ts` - NPC tick processing

**New Files:**
- `src/ai/behaviors/WanderBehavior.ts` - Random movement
- `src/ai/behaviors/FollowBehavior.ts` - Track target
- `src/ai/behaviors/FleeBehavior.ts` - Escape danger
- `src/ai/behaviors/PatrolBehavior.ts` - Route following
- `src/ai/CombatAI.ts` - NPC combat decision tree
- `src/ai/MemoryManager.ts` - Conversation and relationship tracking

### Success Criteria

- [ ] NPC wanders within zone bounds when idle
- [ ] NPC follows companion owner when summoned
- [ ] NPC enters combat and uses abilities against targets
- [ ] NPC flees when HP drops below threshold
- [ ] LLM generates contextual chat based on combat state
- [ ] NPC remembers recent conversation for context
- [ ] NPC relationship values affect behavior (friendly NPCs assist, hostile attack)

  - Rarity (common, uncommon, rare, epic, legendary)
  - Bind rules (bind on pickup, bind on equip, tradeable)
  - Level requirements

#### 2. Inventory Management
- **Storage**

  - Update special ability loadout (4 slots from equipment)
  - Send stat update to client

#### 4. Trading
- **Trade Windows**
  - Player-to-player trades
  - NPC vendor trades
  - Trade confirmation flow

- **Economy**
  - Currency system
  - Vendor buy/sell prices
  - Vendor inventory (static or dynamic)

#### 5. Loot System
- **Loot Tables**

## Integration Points

When implementing combat (Priority 1):

1. **MUD Client** can immediately use:
   - Nearby entity roster → Attack/target selection
   - Approach/Evade buttons → Tactical positioning during combat
   - Macro buttons → Quick ability execution (`attack {target}`, `cast "Drain" {target}`)
   - Position ring widget → Position around target at specific range/angle

2. **LLM Airlock** provides:
   - Combat-aware social modes (NPCs don't chat casually while fighting)
   - CFH gating via `dangerState` (emergency broadcast only in combat/danger)
   - Action validation (prevent illegal actions during combat)

3. **Server Integration**:
   - Set `dangerState: true` in proximity roster when combat starts
   - Send combat events to all clients in range
   - Use spatial data (bearing/elevation/range) for ability targeting validation
   - Update proximity roster as entities move during combat

---

## Notes

- **Spatial Navigation**: Already complete with bearing/elevation/range for all entities
- **Stat System**: Already complete (core stats + 12 derived stats)
- **Ability Loadouts**: Already have slots (8 active, 8 passive, 4 special from equipment)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM, already integrated
- **LLM Integration**: Multi-provider support already working
- **Protocol**: Complete with all message types defined

**Combat is the natural next step** - it leverages everything we've built and unlocks the rest of the gameplay loop.
